## Data Storage

The app stores the following information locally on your device:

- The S3-compatible endpoint URL that you provide
- No other network connections are made

## Third-Party Services

The app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not collect any data. Your S3 credentials and browsed content remain entirely on your device and your specified S3 storage service.

## Data Security

- Credentials are stored using iOS Keychain, which provides hardware-backed encryption
- All S3 connections use the credentials and endpoint you provide
- No data is cached or stored beyond your secure credentials
